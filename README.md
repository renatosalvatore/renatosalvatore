👋 Hi, I'm @renatosalvatore from CL and I have some time to learn from this wonderful world. 👀 🌱 I'm currently learning in a @ucamp Developer full stack program as a graduate program of my university @UTEL. 💞️ the collaborative environment is definitely the best. I'm going the Web App way, 📫 The way to contact me is conventional like everyone else, by here or by email, remember that the essential is invisible to the eyes.

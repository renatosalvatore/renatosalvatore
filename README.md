- 👋 Hi, I’m @renatosalvatore from CL, I am 53 years old and have my life's work done and have the time to learn this wonderful world.
- 👀 I'm interested in learn to program FrontEnd, then backend, why?. sincerely because I will take care myself to update software that I have since 2006 and I need to update it. I have tried with other programmers, but when they see what my project is about, they go three times too far and want to earn in one month the payment of a year. in this sense I have not had much luck, however I have seen many testimonials and reference of people who are in GIT and the vibe is good. I hope to be able to adapt to you, and participate in whatever you require. Greetings.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C#, SQL, CSS3, HTML5 & JS
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with any idea since I have several years in the area of support, digital electronics, system administrator and technology consulting.
- 📫 How to reach me is conventionally as everyone does it, here or via email, if you have a cooler way, let me know how and I'll get in.
